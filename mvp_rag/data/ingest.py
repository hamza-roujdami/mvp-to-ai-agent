üìö Data Ingestion Script for MVP RAG Healthcare AI Assistant

This script populates the Qdrant vector database with healthcare documents
and their embeddings. It demonstrates:

- Sample healthcare document creation
- Embedding generation using Ollama
- Vector database population
- Health monitoring and validation
- Error handling and logging

The documents cover common healthcare topics including:
- Diabetes symptoms and management
- Blood pressure monitoring
- Emergency symptoms recognition
- Stress management and mental health
- Exercise benefits and guidelines
- Sleep health and recommendations
- Preventive healthcare guidelines
- First aid essentials

Author: AI Evolution Demo Team
Purpose: Populate MVP RAG system with healthcare knowledge base
