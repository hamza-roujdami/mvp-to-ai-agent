# 🚀 Agentic RAG - Production AI Agent

## 🎯 Overview
This folder contains the production-ready AI agentic system that evolves from the MVP RAG system. It demonstrates the full Azure-based architecture with advanced AI capabilities.

## 🏗️ Architecture
- **Azure OpenAI**: Advanced LLM for complex reasoning
- **Azure AI Search**: Enterprise-grade vector search
- **Azure Agent Service**: Orchestration and workflow management
- **Azure Content Safety**: Compliance and safety monitoring
- **Azure Monitor**: Observability and metrics

## 🔄 Evolution Path
This system shows how to evolve from:
- ✅ Local tools (Ollama + Qdrant) → Azure services
- ✅ Simple RAG → Agentic workflows
- ✅ Basic metrics → Enterprise observability
- ✅ Local deployment → Cloud scalability
